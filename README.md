- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jon-117
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot. I like data and making it mean something. A little more 
	about me... I want to know more about Brain-Computer-Interfacing, 
	artificial senses, and prosthethics - not just replacements, I'm talking extras.
	
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, and I love it.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that will help me learn more in Python, or 
	generally more about any of the other interests listed above.
	
- 📫 How to reach me: email me at jkonoch@gmail.com
