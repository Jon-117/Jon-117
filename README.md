- 👋 Hi, I’m Jon. I'm a Software Development student at MCTC. 

- 👀 I’m interested in a lot. I love science technology and constantly watch how we're developing as a species and contemplate what these new developments mean for the world as a whole.

- A little more about me... I want to know more about me
	- Automation
	- Brain-Computer-Interfacing
	- artificial senses
 	- prosthethics (not just replacements, I'm talking extras)
	- Microcomputers and other integrated systems
	
- 🌱 I’m currently working through a Capstone class mainly using Python

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that will help me learn more in Python, or 
	generally more about any of the other interests listed above.
