👋 Hi, I’m Jon. I earned my AAS in Software Development Minneapolis Community and Technical College in May of 2024. 

I’m interested in a lot. Really, I can find a way to be interested in almost anything. I love science and technology and constantly watch how it's evolving and contemplate what these new developments mean for the world as a whole.

A little more about me...
- Languages I've worked in
	- Python
	- Java
	- JavaScript
	- HTML
	- CSS
   	- AHK v2
  
- I always want to know more about
	- Automation
	- Brain-Computer-Interfacing
	- artificial senses
 	- prosthethics (not just replacements, I'm talking extras)
	- Microcomputers and other integrated systems



💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that will help me learn more in Python, or 
	generally more about any of the other interests listed above.
